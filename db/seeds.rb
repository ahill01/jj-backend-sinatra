Peach Pit is the second-to-last in the set, and, like its namesake fruit, the taste of the lyrics tend to linger on your tongue. It’s a slow, semi-abstract meditation on the difference between ignorance and apathy. It has the same feeling of laying in the backseat of a car driving down the highway past curfew. The drums could almost be the light-polluting fixtures that are calling out to you in morse code. You’re not sure what they’re saying, but it’s something along the lines of “you are here”. It’s grounding, as the musical texture surrounding you is so dense, it’s almost hard to remember you exist outside the sheltered waves of guitar and bass. The lyrics float on top of the bobbing pulse like sea foam, simultaneously detached and emotional in the way thoughts can only be when you haven’t slept for a while. Or maybe they’re the aftertaste of a lingering buzz. Either way, it seems all your cares are slip-sliding off your train of thought- leaving some sticky residue behind but nothing substantial. The tracks circle back to the uncomfortable question: If the net hurt you cause to yourself and others is the same, is there a moral difference between ignorance and apathy? Is there a difference between not caring and pretending you don’t notice, and not noticing at all in the first place? If you’re going to act the same either way, does it matter? Neither answer is the one you want to hear, but you can’t help asking anyway. The volume swells, the overdrive kicks in, and you realize you’ll find out. When the lights turn on, you can’t help but be illuminated.")
